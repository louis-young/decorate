# Decorate

A React application that renders beautiful, customisable tweets by fetching and aggregating data from the Twitter API.

## Description

A website to create beautiful, customisable tweets with support for reactions, images, replies and threads. You can customise the background colour, theme, size and more and then save or copy the image.

- React.
- React Query.
- React Error Boundary.
- Ramda.
- Tailwind.
- Node.
- Express.
